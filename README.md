# A Kubernates Cloud-Shell (Web Terminal) Operator.

English | [Simplified_Chinese](https://github.com/cloudtty/cloudtty/blob/main/README_zh.md)

# Why cloudtty ?

Existing project `ttyd` already provides great feature to share terminal over the web.
But Kubernetes cloud native enviroment requires a way to run web-tty via `kubernetes` way ( running as pod, and generated by CRD).
So you can try cloudtty.


# SPECIAL THANKS
This project is based on https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd. Many thanks to `tsl0922` `yudai` and the community.
The frontend UI code was originated from `ttyd` project, and the ttyd binary inside the container also comes from `ttyd` project.

# Usage Guide

Step 1: Install Operator and CRD
```
helm repo add daocloud  https://release.daocloud.io/chartrepo/cloudshell
helm install --version 0.0.2 daocloud/cloudshell --generate-name
```

Step 2: Create kube.conf configmap for target cluster (This step will be refined, when the target cluster is the same one this operators runs on)
```
kubectl create configmap my-kubeconfig --from-file=/root/.kube/config

# Be careful to ensure the /root/.kube/config:
#  1. contains the base64 encoded certs/secrets instead of local files.
#  2. the k8s api-server endpoint is reachable(host IP or cluster IP) instead of localhost
```


Step 3: Create a cloud-tty instance by applying CR, then monitor its status
```
kubectl apply -f ./config/samples/webtty_v1alpha1_cloudshell.yaml  && kubectl get cloudshell -w
```



More will be coming Soon.
